Senjo
=====

Universal Chess Interface (UCI) adapter by Shawn Chidester <zd3nik@gmail.com>.

Just write your chess engine and let Senjo's UCIAdapter deal with the UCI protocol.  See [Clubfoot](https://github.com/zd3nik/Clubfoot) for an example chess engine that uses Senjo.

See the [senjo-light](https://github.com/zd3nik/SenjoUCIAdapter/tree/senjo-light) branch for a version that does not include a built-in `test` command.

Description
-----------

Senjo is a UCI adapter for C++ chess engines.  It handles the interaction between your chess engine and any UCI compliant user interface.  All you have to do is implement a ChessEngine class that does the "thinking" parts, Senjo will deal with the rest.

The Senjo UCI adapter comes with a few extra commands that are not part of the UCI specification.  Here are some examples:

    * help
    * fen
    * print
    * perft
    * test

In particular the *perft* and *test* commands are very handy for testing and tuning.  A few EPD files are included in this repository for use with these commands.  But of course you can use any EPD file(s) you prefer.

How-To
------

To create a chess engine named "Trout" using the Senjo UCI adapter do the following:

    1. Extend the "ChessEngine" class.

        // TroutEngine.h
        #include "senjo/ChessEngine.h"

        class TroutEngine : public senjo::ChessEngine {
            // implement required ChessEngine methods
            // see ChessEngine.h for documentation
        };

    2. Wrap TroutEngine in a Senjo UCIAdapter and feed it one line of input from stdin at a time.

        // TroutMain.cpp
        #include "TroutEngine.h"
        #include "senjo/UCIAdapter.h"
        #include "senjo/Output.h"

        int main(int /*argc*/, char** /*argv*/) {
            try {
                TroutEngine engine;
                senjo::UCIAdapter adapter(engine);

                std::string line;
                line.reserve(16384);

                while (std::getline(std::coin, line)) {
                    if (!adapter.doCommand(line)) {
                        break;
                    }
                }

                return 0;
            }
            catch (const std::exception& e) {
                senjo::Output() << "ERROR: " << e.what();
                return 1;
            }
        }


Notes
-----

This example uses `std::getline` to obtain one line of input at a time from stdin.  This is only an example.  You may get input any way you prefer.  All that is required is that you assign each line of input to a std::string, pass it to the senjo::UCIAdapter's doCommand() method, and exit the input loop if doCommand() returns false.

The `senjo::Output` class (from Output.h) is very useful for debugging.  Use it anywhere; it's thread safe and it prefixes your output with "string info " so it won't confuse UCI compliant user interfaces.  See `Output.h` for more details.

The senjo source directory contains a `CMakelists.txt` file, which is a cmake project file.  If you're using cmake simply add the senjo directory to your project with `add_subirectory(senjo)`.  If you're not using cmake simply remove he CMakeLists.txt file and include the senjo source files in your project in whatever way is most convenient for you.
